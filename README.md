# Decentralized Time Bank

## Project Description

The Decentralized Time Bank is a revolutionary blockchain-based platform that enables individuals to exchange time-based services using a peer-to-peer system. Unlike traditional monetary exchanges, this platform operates on the principle that everyone's time is equally valuable - one hour of service equals one time token, regardless of the type of service provided. Users can offer their skills and expertise while earning time credits that can be spent on services they need from other community members.

The platform creates a collaborative economy where community members help each other by trading time instead of money, fostering local connections and skill sharing. Whether you're a professional offering consulting services, a student providing tutoring, or someone offering household assistance, the Decentralized Time Bank ensures fair and transparent exchanges.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a global community-driven economy that values time equally across all individuals, breaking down traditional economic barriers and promoting social cooperation. We aim to build a sustainable ecosystem where people can access services they need while contributing their own unique skills, ultimately reducing economic inequality and strengthening community bonds.

The Decentralized Time Bank envisions a future where:
- Time becomes the universal currency for service exchange
- Skills and knowledge are freely shared across communities
- Economic participation is accessible to everyone regardless of financial status
- Local communities are strengthened through mutual assistance
- Blockchain technology ensures transparent and fair transactions

## Key Features

- **Equal Time Valuation**: Every hour of service is valued equally, promoting fairness and inclusivity
- **Skill-Based Matching**: Users can register multiple skills and find relevant service requests
- **Reputation System**: Built-in reputation scoring encourages quality service delivery
- **Transparent Transactions**: All exchanges are recorded on the blockchain for complete transparency
- **Initial Time Balance**: New users receive starting time credits to participate immediately

- **Secure Smart Contracts**: Automated execution of agreements without intermediaries

## Future Scope

- **Mobile Application**: Develop user-friendly mobile apps for iOS and Android platforms
- **Advanced Matching Algorithm**: Implement AI-powered matching based on location, skills, and availability
- **Multi-Language Support**: Expand platform accessibility with internationalization
- **Integration with IoT**: Connect with smart devices for automatic service verification
- **Governance Token**: Introduce community governance for platform decisions and upgrades
- **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Enable time token transfers across different blockchain networks
- **Enhanced Reputation System**: Implement more sophisticated reputation metrics and verification
- **Local Community Hubs**: Create location-based community groups and specialized service categories
- **Integration with Traditional Payment Systems**: Hybrid model allowing both time and monetary exchanges
- **Advanced Analytics**: Provide insights and analytics for community health and engagement

### Quick Setup (TL;DR)

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Create `backend/.env` with MongoDB connection:
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
     DB_NAME=timebank
     PORT=4000
     ```
   - Create `frontend/.env`:
     ```env
     VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
     ```

3. **Start MongoDB** (local or use MongoDB Atlas)

4. **Start backend** (Terminal 1):
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

5. **Start frontend** (Terminal 2):
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open browser:** http://localhost:5173

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + Wagmi + RainbowKit
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Socket.io
- **Blockchain:** Solidity + Hardhat + Ethereum Sepolia
- **Storage:** MongoDB (reliable, fast, no IPFS dependencies)

## Backend API

The backend server provides:
